# Motor Vehicle Theft Analysis

### Overview
This project, developed as part of the my capstone project at Northeastern University, explores and analyzes motor vehicle theft data from January 2013 to September 2022. We employ advanced predictive modeling techniques such as SARIMA for time series forecasting, Random Forest for classification and clustering to identify distinct patterns in the temporal and spatial distribution of thefts. These methods enhance our understanding of crime patterns and assist in developing effective prevention strategies.

### Predictive Modeling Techniques Applied

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA):** Used to forecast vehicle theft trends by analyzing seasonal patterns and temporal trends, enabling proactive law enforcement responses

- **Random Forest Classification:** Differentiates between 'Theft Over' and 'Non-Theft Over' incidents using factors like timing and location, aiding in pinpointing high-risk scenarios

- **Clustering:** Utilizes k-means and hierarchical methods to cluster theft incidents, identifying common characteristics for better resource allocation and targeted patrolling

These techniques collectively enhance our capability to predict, understand, and respond to vehicle thefts effectively.

### Objectives
- Analyze temporal and spatial trends to pinpoint high-risk periods and locations
- Use predictive analytics to forecast theft incidents and understand influential factors
- Provide actionable insights to law enforcement and community safety organizations for better resource allocation and strategic planning

### Data
The dataset includes detailed records of theft incidents over nearly a decade, offering comprehensive insights into the patterns and dynamics of criminal activity.

### Methodology
Our approach integrates rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and sophisticated modeling techniques to draw meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.

### Tools Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data manipulation and modeling
- **Libraries:** Utilized Pandas for data management, Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for predictive modeling

### Results
Our predictive models have unveiled potential future theft hotspots and times, empowering more effective preventative measures and strategic responses by law enforcement agencies.
